## 🎯 Problem Statement
The PM Internship Scheme receives applications from thousands of youth across India, many of whom:
- Are first-generation learners with limited digital exposure.
- Have no prior internship experience.
- Struggle to identify suitable opportunities from hundreds of listings.

This mismatch leads to **misaligned applications** and **missed opportunities**.  
Our solution addresses this gap with a **guided, personalized recommendation system**.
